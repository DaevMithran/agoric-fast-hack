# Agoric Developer Tooling: Agoric VM & Orchestrator

Welcome to the Agoric Developer Tooling repository! This project introduces two innovative tools designed to enhance the development experience in the Agoric ecosystem:

- **Agoric VM**
- **Agoric Orchestrator**

Both tools aim to simplify complex workflows, promote rapid prototyping, and empower developers with live testing and educational resources.

## Agoric VM

The Agoric VM streamlines the setup of multichain environments for Agoric using **Vagrant**. It allows developers to quickly bootstrap their development environment by simply configuring a .yaml file.

### Multichain Setup Made Easy:

Configure your multichain setup with a YAML file to deploy a development-ready environment.

### How to Use

- git clone https://github.com/DaevMithran/agoric-fast-hack.git
- cd agoric-vm
- vagrant up --provider=virtualbox

## Agoric Orchestrator

The Agoric Orchestrator revolutionizes how developers design and manage multichain workflows. With this no-code tool, developers can orchestrate multichain interactions seamlessly.
Key Features:

### No-Code Workflow Design:

- Define multichain orchestrations visually, without writing a single line of code.
- Flexible Multichain Support: Integrate with multiple chains to create robust workflows.

## How to Use:

- git clone https://github.com/DaevMithran/agoric-fast-hack.git
- cd agoric-remix
- yarn
- yarn dev

### Developers Guide

To further empower developers, weâ€™ve integrated:

- Live Smart Contract Testing: Test your contracts in real-time using a multichain simulation.
- Developer Courses: Interactive tutorials available on remix.agoric.io to guide you through Agoric's ecosystem and tooling.

### Future Developments

- A vscode extension for testing contracts with prefunded address for devleoper testing
